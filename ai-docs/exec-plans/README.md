# vsphere-problem-detector Execution Plans

**Last Updated:** 2026-05-01

## Purpose

Execution plans (exec-plans) guide feature planning and implementation for vsphere-problem-detector.

Use this directory to document:
- Feature design proposals
- Implementation plans
- Spike investigations
- Proof-of-concept findings

---

## When to Create an Exec Plan

Create an exec plan when:
- ✅ Implementing a significant new feature
- ✅ Making architectural changes
- ✅ Investigating a complex problem
- ✅ Proposing a major refactor

Don't create an exec plan for:
- ❌ Bug fixes (unless they require design changes)
- ❌ Minor improvements
- ❌ Routine maintenance

---

## Exec Plan Format

### Template Structure

```markdown
# Feature Name

**Status:** Draft | In Review | Approved | Implemented
**Author:** GitHub handle
**Created:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Epic:** Link to GitHub epic issue

## Problem Statement

What problem are we solving? Why does it matter?

## Goals

- Goal 1
- Goal 2

## Non-Goals

- What we're explicitly NOT doing
- Out of scope items

## Proposed Solution

High-level approach to solving the problem.

### Architecture

Component diagrams, data flow, etc.

### API Changes

New APIs, changed APIs, deprecated APIs.

### Migration Path

How existing users/resources migrate to new behavior.

## Alternatives Considered

- **Alternative 1:** Description and why not chosen
- **Alternative 2:** Description and why not chosen

## Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1:** Milestone 1
   - Story 1.1
   - Story 1.2

2. **Phase 2:** Milestone 2
   - Story 2.1
   - Story 2.2

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- E2E scenarios

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Risk 1 | High | Mitigation strategy |

## Success Criteria

How do we know the feature is successful?

- Metric 1
- Metric 2
- User feedback

## Timeline

- **Week 1-2:** Design and review
- **Week 3-4:** Implementation phase 1
- **Week 5-6:** Implementation phase 2
- **Week 7:** Testing and documentation

## Open Questions

- Question 1?
- Question 2?
```

## Exec Plan Workflow

### 1. Draft

- Author creates exec plan document
- Shares with team for early feedback
- Iterates on design

### 2. Review

- Team reviews exec plan
- Discusses alternatives
- Identifies risks
- Approves or requests changes

### 3. Approved

- Exec plan is approved
- Implementation can begin
- Epic/stories created based on plan

### 4. Implemented

- Feature implemented
- Tests passing
- Documentation updated
- Exec plan archived for reference

---

## Example Exec Plans

*(Create example exec plan files as features are implemented)*

- `feature-async-processing.md` - Async processing support
- `spike-performance-optimization.md` - Performance investigation
- `refactor-controller-architecture.md` - Architecture refactor

---

## Relationship to ADRs

**Exec Plans vs ADRs:**

- **Exec Plan:** Feature design and implementation plan
  - Created before implementation
  - Describes what and how
  - May span multiple epics/sprints

- **ADR:** Architectural decision record
  - Created during or after implementation
  - Documents why a decision was made
  - Explains trade-offs considered

**Workflow:**
1. Create exec plan for feature
2. During implementation, significant architectural decisions → ADR
3. After implementation, exec plan archived, ADRs remain as reference
